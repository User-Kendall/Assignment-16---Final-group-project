              <p class="card-text">Nina Craigmiles was seven years old when she died on St. Luke's Day: October 18, 1871. A buggy in which she was riding -- or possibly driving; she was said to occasionally take the reins despite her young age -- was hit by a locomotive in downtown Cleveland, Tennessee. Nina was crushed beneath the engine wheels.</p>
              <p class="card-text">Her father, John Henderson Craigmiles, was overcome with grief and had the money to share it with everyone in town. He bought the land where both Nina and her mom had been born -- it was only a few blocks from Nina's death spot -- and commissioned a Gothic Revival style church to be built on the property. Named St. Luke's Memorial Episcopal Church, it opened on the third anniversary of Nina's death.</p>
              <img src="https://www.roadsideamerica.com/attract/images/tn/TNCLEnina_ks09.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-4" alt="Entrance to Tomb">
              <p class="card-text">The church was a pretext for what came next: an elaborate, adjacent tomb for Nina (the church cost $22,000, the tomb $20,000 -- well over a half-million dollars in today's money). Built of white Carrera marble from Italy, with walls four feet thick and a spire over 37 feet high, Nina's mausoleum is big enough to qualify as a small house. On its ceiling, overlooking anyone who enters, are carved marble versions of Nina's face with wings, as well as a silver dove of peace visible through glass in the lofty cupola. The mausoleum was completed in 1875, and what remained of Nina was then entombed within a marble sarcophagus topped with a carving of a fringed blanket, a crown, and a cross. Unlike other churchyards with graves, St. Luke's only has this one.</p>
              <p class="card-text">Honestly, the Craigmiles would have been happier living somewhere other than Cleveland. Not only did Nina meet her doom in town, but Mr. Craigmiles died after falling on an icy Cleveland street in 1899, and Mrs. Craigmiles was run over and killed by a car in front of her Cleveland house in 1928. Both were interred next to Nina.</p>
