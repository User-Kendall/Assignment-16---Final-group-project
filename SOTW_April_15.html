              <p class="card-text">If you've been to a natural history museum in the past 20 years, even one in a relatively small city or university, you've probably seen a dinosaur skeleton, or at least a dinosaur skull. And if you've been to as many museums as we have, you start to wonder: where did all of these dinosaur bones come from?</p>
              <p class="card-text">The Rocky Mountain Dinosaur Resource Center (RMDRC) is a kind of greatest hits collection of dinosaurabilia, because its bones and bone casts are in hundreds of museums worldwide. Eric Goderis, a long-time tour guide at the Center, told us that the RMDRC is the largest commercial paleontology lab in the U.S., and that its staff unearths prehistoric skeletons at sites across the Great Plains and the American West, and makes money by selling them.</p>
              <p class="card-text">The museum part of the RMDRC, while satisfying to the dinosaur-crazed public, is also a showroom for potential customers. If you have a million dollars and want a mounted dinosaur skeleton, you visit here first to see if you like how it looks.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Eric enlightened us on the business of dinosaur display. First, you don't call the duplicates made at the RMDRC "replicas." They're "casts," precision copies, indistinguishable from the real thing. The RMDRC makes casts of all of the dinosaurs that it finds, and can sell multiple copies to multiple interested buyers. Eric said that a trick to spotting a genuine fossil skeleton in a museum is to look for the steel frame that holds it together: if it's carefully wrapped around the bones, they're original. A cast copy's bones, however, has its framework drilled right through them.</p>
