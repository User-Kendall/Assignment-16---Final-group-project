              <p class="card-text">The Rocky Mountain Dinosaur Resource Center in Woodland Park, Colorado, is a museum devoted to the preservation, discovery, and education of dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures. It features displays of dinosaur fossils, skeletons, and life-size reconstructions. Visitors can explore exhibits on various dinosaur species, learn about paleontology, and even participate in fossil preparation demonstrations. The center offers an interactive and educational experience for dinosaur enthusiasts of all ages.</p>
              <p class="card-text">The cat, 19 feet long, was built in the late 1960s as a float for New York City's Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. A brown tabby with an impish smile, it has big eyelashes and a little Santa stocking cap perched jauntily on its head. Old film clips show the cat slowly motoring down Broadway as it sat atop a six-foot-high wheel of fake Swiss cheese. The cat's eyes opened and closed, apparently too sleepy to notice the humans dressed as cartoon mice that walked beside it.</p>

              <p class="card-text">When Macy's purged its warehouse in the early 1970s, garbageman Billy Moriarty was approached to haul several old floats, including the cat, to the dump. A dinosaur and Cinderella's castle met their end in a crusher, and the cheese was sacrificed as well. But Billy, who loves animals, couldn't bear to destroy the cat. "I just fell in love with it," he told us. "I didn't want to ever get rid of it."</p>
              <p class="card-text">And he didn't. For the next 50 years Billy found safe havens for the big cat atop friends' business rooftops -- we visited one in the early 2000s -- and inside storage units and warehouses, all in northern New Jersey.</p>
