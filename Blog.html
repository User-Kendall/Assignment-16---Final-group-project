            <p class="card-text">The official name of an attraction can make all the difference in our decision to detour, or even stop to investigate. We sometimes refer to a point-of-interest by a nickname we’ve coined, to clarify its oddity-appeal, while improving the chance our readers may visit in person. The dull-sounding County Historical Museum of Prairie Quilts may camouflage its true treasure: a petrified organ grinder’s monkey rolled in a cursed rug (We made that one up, but you get the idea). In the world of real attractions, some people allow a name to nourish their fantasies a bit too much.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Explorers and tourists in the past have abused caves, snapping off stalactites and other formations for souvenirs, leaving only stumps. That isn’t tolerated any more, but the damage had been done and was irreversible. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Until now! Fantastic Caverns in Springfield, Missouri, is having its past mutilations repaired — by Jonathan Beard, a Cave Doctor. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Jon worked at a 3M adhesive plant, where he became familiar with epoxy. He was also very familiar with caves (Missouri has over 7,500). Jon told us that he’d spent decades as an amateur caver, photographing and mapping subterranean passages beneath the Ozarks. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Combining these two areas of expertise, Jon found that epoxy putty could not only be used to glue a broken piece of cave back into place — in the rare instances when the original could be found — but could also be shaped to create entirely new, replacement formations: prosthetic stalagmites, stalactites, columns, canopies, draperies.</p>

            <p class="card-text">December 3, 2023 </p>
            <p> <img src="https://www.roadsideamerica.com/attract/images/nv/NVLVEpunkmus_dk_5062_430x323.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Punk Rock Museum Photography."></p>
            <p class="card-text">The Punk Rock Museum opened in 2023 in Las Vegas. We visited in June, a few months later. The collection is crammed with artifacts from 50 years of punk culture, filling every space with huge blow ups of concert photos, and thousands of images, art, posters, and zines. 
              <br>
              <br>
              The museum’s inaugural special exhibit features concert images by photographer Rikki Ercoli. We know Rikki from our college days on Venue Magazine (he was then called “Spacerick.”). In the 1970s he jumped into the Philadelphia and New York club scene with his 35mm camera and b/w film, following Patti Smith, Sex Pistols and the Ramones. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Now living in San Francisco, he recently talked about the exhibit, and how he “loved the sarcasm of the punk bands.” Fanatical in his desire to see every act that came to town, Rikki captured images of the early luminaries, such as Debbie Harry and Sid Vicious (framed prints are available for purchase in The Punk Rock Museum gift shop).</p>
